# YSoft SafeQ Mobile Print SDK Android

This repository intends to deliver the mobile SDK for Android within a sample mobile application, developed for the YSoft Corporation a.s., for accessing the functionality of SafeQ product.

The main functionality included in the SDK is the login and upload to the YSoft SafeQ using two main channels - End User Interface and the Mobile Integration Gateway.

The mobile SDK is supplied in the *sdk* folder. It includes *Login.kt* and *Upload.kt* classes comprising the core functionality of SDK and *Printjob.kt* class representing the print jobs to be uploaded to the YSoft SafeQ. The *sdk* folder also contains *CustomTrust.java* class for resolving YSoft-signed certificate issues and also *IppEmptyRequest.kt* and *IppRequest.kt* classes implemented by Petr Barto≈à as a part of his Master's thesis, for building MIG rewuests. Their integration into the code is shown in the *LoginActivity.kt* and *UploadActivity.kt* classes. The application contains only basic UI elements as they will be chosen and modified by software engineers developing the mobile application with their custom assets. 

For more detailed instructions on how to integrate the mobile SDK into your iOS application and utilize its functionality, see the bachelor's thesis... 


## User Experience
The minimal required version of Android is Marshmallow - 6.0 (API 23).

You can launch the application by opening the topmost folder through the Android Studio IDE. 

The application presents a login screen with input textfields:
 * The server textfield is filled by the address of the desired endpoint:
    * EUI/MPS: https://server-with-eui:9443/end-user/ui/
    * MIG: https://server-with-mig:8050
 * The username and password textfields are filled by the YSoft SafeQ credentials
 
After the successful login, the upload screen is presented. At the top, the *Add file* button adds an empty generic *test.txt* file to the table view. After adding file(s) to the tableview, the upload may be initiated after clicking the *Upload* button. If the upload of the files succeeds, they may be displayed in the end user interface at https://server-with-eui/end-user/ui/. These print jobs may be released by authenticating at any printer with SafeQ installed.
